                <h3>Personal Info</h3>
                <p>Hello, my name is Jaxon. I'm an undergrad student at
                    Utah Valley University, pursuing a bachelor's degree
                    in software engineering. I was born and raised in
                    Utah County. I'm married to my wonderful wife Lexi who is an undergrad nursing student.
                    We are both excited to be graduating in a couple years so we can spend more time together
                    again.
                </p>

                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p>Outside of work, I like to play all types of games. Board games,
                    card games, and video games. I like to watch TV shows over movies, my
                    favorite genres are action and comedy. I love to play pickleball and ping pong.
                    If I was good enough to make a living off of playing those, I totally would.</p>
